# Repository Package

This package would normally contain Spring Data JPA repositories for database access.

However, since we're using an in-memory implementation for this service, the actual implementation has been moved to the `data` package with classes such as:

- `DataProvider`: Provides in-memory video and DIY data
- `UserInteractionData`: Provides in-memory user interaction data
- `UserHistoryData`: Provides in-memory user history data

When migrating to a database in the future, you can either:
1. Create repositories in this package that implement Spring Data JPA interfaces
2. Update the existing data providers to use database access

## Migration Plan

For future database integration:

1. Add appropriate database dependencies to build.gradle
2. Configure database connection in application.yml
3. Convert model classes to JPA entities with proper annotations
4. Create Spring Data repositories in this package
5. Update service implementations to use these repositories

The existing service interfaces would remain the same, maintaining compatibility with the rest of the application.
