# SLM Integration Plan for Recommendation System

## Current Implementation
The recommendation system currently uses a simple algorithm based on category matching and user watch history. The code is structured to allow future integration of SLM (Small Language Models) for more advanced recommendations.

## What is SLM?
Small Language Models are compact versions of larger language models that can be used for specific tasks like:
- Text embedding generation
- Semantic similarity calculation
- Content categorization

Unlike large models (LLMs), these models are small enough to run locally and don't require significant computing resources.

## Free SLM Options for Our Project

1. **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2**
   - Size: 80MB
   - Embedding dimensions: 384
   - Perfect for our recommendation system
   - Works well for comparing content similarity

2. **all-mpnet-base-v2**
   - Size: 420MB
   - Higher quality but requires more memory
   - Better for nuanced content relationships

3. **paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2**
   - Size: 970MB
   - Supports multiple languages
   - Useful if we expand internationally

## How SLM Will Improve Recommendations

1. **Content Understanding**: SLM will understand the semantic meaning of video titles, descriptions, and tags
2. **User Profiling**: Create embeddings for user preferences based on watch history
3. **Similarity Matching**: Find truly similar content rather than just matching categories

## Step-by-Step Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation
- ✅ Add TODO markers in codebase for future SLM integration
- ✅ Create README-SLM-TODO.md with detailed plan
- ✅ Keep current implementation working without changes

### Phase 2: Basic Integration
- [ ] Add model dependencies
- [ ] Create embedding classes for content representation
- [ ] Implement basic embedding generation for videos

### Phase 3: Enhanced Recommendations
- [ ] Replace category-based matching with embedding similarity
- [ ] Generate user profiles using watch history
- [ ] Implement hybrid recommendation approach

### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] Add caching for embeddings
- [ ] Implement batch processing for efficiency
- [ ] Add monitoring for recommendation quality

## Technical Details

All TODOs are marked in the codebase, particularly in:
- `SlmRepositoryImpl.java` - Main implementation class with TODOs
- `README-SLM-TODO.md` - Detailed technical plan
